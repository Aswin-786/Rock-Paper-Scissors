# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game created for learning purposes. It is a classic hand game typically played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "rock," "paper," and "scissors," and the winner is determined based on the rules:

- Rock beats scissors (Rock crushes scissors)
- Scissors beats paper (Scissors cut paper)
- Paper beats rock (Paper covers rock)

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on one of the three buttons representing your choice: "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
3. The computer will randomly choose one of the three options.
4. The game will display the result, indicating whether you won, lost, or tied against the computer.
